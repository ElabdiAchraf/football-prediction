# Football Match Probability Prediction ⚽⚽⚽

### Build a Predective Machine Learning Model to predict the outcome of football matches (victory, draw, loss) using Logistic Regression Algorithm

#### Competition Description
  <bold>Football </bold> has been at the heart of data science for more than a decade. If today's algorithms focus on event detection, player style, or team analysis, predicting the results of a match stays an open challenge.

  Predicting the outcomes of a match between two teams depends mostly (but not only) on their current form. The form of a team can be viewed as their recent sequence of results versus the other teams. So match probabilities between two teams can be different given their calendar.

  This competition is about predicting the probabilities of more than 150000 match outcomes using the recent sequence of 10 matches of the teams.
